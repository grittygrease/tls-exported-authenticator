--- abstract

This document describes a mechanism in Transport Layer Security (TLS) to
provide an exportable proof of ownership of a certificate that can be
transmitted out of band and verified by the other party.

# Introduction

This document provides a way to authenticate one party of a Transport Layer
Security (TLS) communication to another using a certificate after the session
has been established.  This allows both the client and server to prove ownership
of additional identities at any time after the handshake has completed.  This
proof of authentication can be exported and transmitted out of band from one
party to be validated by the other party.

This mechanism provides two advantages over the authentication that TLS natively
provides:

multiple identities -

: Endpoints that are authoritative for multiple identities - but do not have a
  single certificate that includes all of the identities - can authenticate with
  those identities over a single connection.

spontaneous authentication -

: Endpoints can authenticate after a connection is established, in response to
  events in a higher-layer protocol, as well as integrating more context.

This document intends to replace much of the functionality of renegotiation
in previous versions of TLS.  It has the advantages over renegotiation of not
requiring additional on-the-wire changes during a connection.  For simplicity,
only TLS 1.2 and later are supported.

Post-handshake authentication is defined in TLS 1.3, but it has
the disadvantage of requiring additional state to be stored in the TLS
state machine and it composes poorly with multiplexed connection protocols
like HTTP/2.  It is also only available for client authentication.  This
mechanism is intended to be used as part of a replacement for post-handshake
authentication in applications.

# Authenticator

The authenticator is a structured message that can be exported from either
party of a TLS connection.  It can be sent out-of-band to the other party
of a TLS connection to be validated.

An authenticator message can be constructed by either the client or the
server given an established TLS connection, a certificate, and a corresponding private
key.  This authenticator uses the message structures from section 4.4. of
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}, but different parameters.  Also, unlike the Certificate and
CertificateRequest messages in TLS 1.3, the messages described in this draft
are not encrypted with a handshake key.

Each authenticator is computed using a Handshake Context and Finished MAC Key
derived from the TLS session.  The Handshake Context is identical
for both parties of the TLS connection, the Finished MAC Key is dependent
on whether the authenticator is created by the client or the server.

* The Handshake Context is an {{!RFC5705}} (for TLS 1.2) or
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} (for TLS 1.3) exporter value derived using the label
"EXPORTER-authenticator handshake context" and length 64 bytes.

* The Finished MAC Key is an exporter value derived using the label
"EXPORTER-server authenticator finished key" or "EXPORTER-client authenticator
finished key", depending on the sender.  The length of this key is equal to the
length of the output of the hash function selected in TLS for the pseudorandom
function (PRF); cipher suites that do not use the TLS PRF MUST define a hash
function that can be used for this purpose or they cannot be used.

If the connection is TLS 1.2, the master secret MUST have been computed
with the extended master secret {{!RFC7627}} to avoid key synchronization attacks.

Certificate
: The certificate to be used for authentication and any
supporting certificates in the chain.

The certificate message contains an opaque string called
certificate_request_context which SHOULD be unique for a given connection.  Its format
should be defined by the application layer protocol and SHOULD be non-zero
length.  For example, it may be a sequence number used by the higher-level
protocol during the transport of the authenticator to the other party.  Using
a unique value allows the application to prevent replays by tying the authenticator
to a given context.

CertificateVerify
: A signature over the value
Hash(Handshake Context || Certificate)

Finished
: A HMAC over the value
Hash(Handshake Context || Certificate || CertificateVerify)
using the hash function from the handshake and the Finished MAC Key as a key.
{:br}

The certificates used in the Certificate message MUST conform to the requirements
of a Certificate message in the version of TLS negotiated.  This is
described in section 4.2.3. of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} and
sections 7.4.2. and 7.4.6. of {{!RFC5246}}.

The exported authenticator message is the concatenation of messages:
Certificate || CertificateVerify || Finished

# API considerations

The creation and validation of exported authenticators SHOULD be implemented inside
TLS library even if it is possible to implement it at the application layer.
TLS implementations supporting the use of exported authenticators MUST provide
application programming interfaces by which clients and servers may request
and verify exported authenticator messages.

Given an established connection, the application should be able to obtain an
authenticator by providing the following:

 * certificate_request_context (from 1 to 255 bytes)
 * valid certificate chain for the connection and associated extensions
(OCSP, SCT, etc.)
 * signer (either the private key associated with the certificate, or interface
to perform private key operation)

Given an established connection and an exported authenticator message, the
application should be able to provide the authenticator to the connection.
If the Finished and CertificateVerify messages verify, the TLS library should
return the following:

 * certificate chain and extensions
 * certificate_request_context

In order for the application layer to communicate which certificates it will
accept, an API should be exposed that returns an array of TLS 1.3 SignatureScheme
objects that corresponds to the signature algorithms that the library is
willing to validate in an exported authenticator message.

# Security Considerations

The Certificate/Verify/Finished pattern intentionally looks like the TLS 1.3
pattern which now has been analyzed several times.  In the case where the
client presents an authenticator to a server, {{SIGMAC}} presents a relevant
framework for analysis.

Authenticators are independent and unidirectional. There is no explicit state change
inside TLS when an authenticator is either created or validated.

* This property makes it difficult to formally prove
that a server is jointly authoritative over multiple certificates, rather than
individually authoritative over each.
* There is no indication in the TLS layer about which point in time an authenticator was
computed.  Any feedback about the time of creation or validation of the authenticator
should be tracked as part of the application layer semantics if required.
